I spent a couple of days measuring and drawing this CC1310 board in SolidWorks. Unfortunatelly i coundn't find it anywhere. Hope you like it :)

Obs1: If you are going to import this file to a PCB designer Software (Like Altium, Eagle, KiCad), i suggest that you use STEP AP214 file (colors are included)

Obs2: Please credit my work so that other people can find it. Thank You

Obs3: maybe the .sldprt file will appear to you all in a single color. You can change the faces' color following this steps:

1. Select a Face;
2. Click in Appearences;
3. Select Face;
4. Choose the color and press OK

My Colors in RGB:

RED = 113,0,0;
Yellow = 255,181,31;
White = 247,247,247;
Black/Grey =29,2929;
